# OpenMaps-Drawing
![WIP Image](http://denouncetheclock.com/publicimages/Unity_OSM2.png)
A 'library' for drawing XML data from the [Open Street Map](http://openstreetmap.org) project in Unity. 
A definite work in progress- master not guaranteed to be in a position to run (I know...), neither is the development branch.
